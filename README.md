# Why Rust ?

> Rust is a general purpose language that can be successfully deployed in many areas. Its headline domain is systems programming, an area most prominently occupied by C & C++. Yet the boundary of that domain is quite porous. Historically, it would have covered software such as operating systems, compilers, interpreters, file systems and device drivers. Now, it would also include web browsers and other software, even if it are user-facing.
— Rust in action.


> Rust supports WebAssembly (WASM), a standard for deploying apps into browsers without JavaScript, as a first-class citizen. WASM allows you to compile and deploy your Rust project to the server, IoT devices, mobile devices and the browser.
